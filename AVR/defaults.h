/* The defaults.h file serves as a central default settings file for different machine
   types, from DIY CNC mills to CNC conversions of off-the-shelf machines. The settings
   here are supplied by users, so your results may vary. However, this should give you
   a good starting point as you get to know your machine and tweak the settings for your
   our nefarious needs. */
